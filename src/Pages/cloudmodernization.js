                <p>Digital transformation can be empowering at an organizational scale. It can help transform the
customer experience, power innovation, increase agility and flexibility, reduce operating costs and drive
data-based decision-making. A successful application modernization strategy starts with the business
need in mind, and then focuses on technologies. As the journey to the cloud gathers pace, organizations
have been looking for ways to accelerate cloud adoption and for a prescriptive approach to application
modernization.
</p>
<p>Modernizing your business applications is an inevitable aspect of doing business. We help you decide
on how to migrate your applications and at what pace, leveraging the industry’s most reliable
infrastructure with the deepest set of services. When deploying to Cloud, enterprises can reduce
payback periods to 6 months and reduce total cost of ownership (TCO) by 64%. We will execute your
cloud migration and application modernization plans based on your business needs and not
agreements or licensing. To modernize we will lift and shift applications, refactor them or fully
re-platform them, making the choice that best suits your organization. Modernizing your applications
with Cloud based infrastructure can reduce costs, gain efficiencies and make the most of your existing
investments.</p>
<strong>We accelerate your migration to the cloud</strong>
<p>Your business applications are the engines that help run your company, allowing you to make decisions,
gain insights, and process valuable data. As part of your digital transformation journey, when you
migrate to Cloud, you reach new levels of operational efficiency, increased scalability and improved
performance. Given this, migration to the cloud requires a provider with experience in retiring
datacenters, the right programs and enterprise technologies ready to move applications to the cloud.
We offer exclusive Cloud modernization services to migrate databases, servers and data, giving you the
right tools to achieve your cloud migration.</p>
<strong>We maximize the value of your existing investments</strong>
<p>As your journey to the cloud matures, your organization will want to maximize the value of existing
hardware, software and business applications. Part of your digital strategy will likely require that you
run hybrid environments and maximize the use of your existing solutions built on Microsoft Windows
Server, VMWare Cloud, Oracle, or IBM. By moving to Cloud, you can use innovative technology to run all
your existing systems on a platform that allows integration with legacy applications and cloud native
solutions. This gives you the ability to run your most valuable enterprise applications in the cloud and
empower you to get best return from your assets, both legacy, new and everything in between.
</p>
<strong>We drive growth, retire legacy investments and improve your financial stability</strong>
<p>Enterprises looking to modernize technology can save money by using Cloud infrastructure as they
build new applications and retire legacy solutions. When we plan your cloud migration, your
organization can significantly reduce TCO, freeing up resources to focus on the enterprise’s core mission
and not in managing servers and buildings. In addition, the hyper-scale, breadth of services and level of
automation in the Cloud can achieve incremental savings, and over time, significant cost optimization.
When we deploy enterprise solutions in Cloud, you can retire expensive legacy infrastructure, reduce
costs, gain agility through automation, and free resources to drive innovation, as opposed focusing on
undifferentiated work.
</p>
<strong>Modernization Readiness</strong>
<p>We provide an application questionnaire in the assessment phase to evaluate and rationalize your
organization’s application portfolio and determine the business, functional, technical, and financial
significance of applications in the portfolio. This assessment determines how well your organization can
support the future state architecture of these applications, after modernization. Our modernization
strategy involves the following steps:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Evaluating modernization readiness for applications in the Cloud</li>
    <li>Phased approach to modernizing applications in the Cloud</li>
    <li>Decomposing monoliths into microservices</li>
    <li>Integrating microservices using serverless offerings in the cloud</li>
    <li>Enabling data persistence in microservices</li>
</ul>
<strong>Executing the Modernization</strong>
<strong>Actionables</strong> 
<ul>
    <li>Determine the milestones for converting your applications’ source code and data.</li>
    <li>Complete the mapping of all operational areas to ensure that required standards and
procedures for operating and administering the new target environment are addressed.
</li>
    <li>Implement an infrastructure solution that can address your reliability, accessibility, and growth
requirements by using cloud-native approaches and best-of-breed languages and frameworks.
The components of a modernized application have these characteristics:
  <ol>
      <li>Packaged as lightweight containers</li>
      <li>Designed as loosely coupled microservices</li>
      <li>Centered around APIs for interaction and collaboration</li>
      <li>Architected with a clean separation of stateless and stateful services</li>
      <li>Isolated from server and operating system dependencies</li>
      <li>Deployed on self-service, elastic, cloud infrastructure</li>
      <li>Managed through agile DevOps processes</li>
      <li>Include automated capabilities</li>
      <li>Provide defined, policy-driven resource allocation</li>
  </ol>
</li> 
</ul>
<strong>Results</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Target state data model design</li>
    <li>Organizational readiness built though training and tool improvements (change management
and operational model)</li>
    <li>Regular cadence established for change activities</li>
    <li>Refined operating model and measurement of delivery effectiveness</li>
    <li>Key business case metrics, which are tracked and reported for value delivered</li>
    <li>Continuation of refinement and automation activities</li>
    <li>A modernization roadmap that defines the strategy that is applied to each application and how it can scale</li>
    <li>Preparation and implementation of modernization, including iterative testing deliveries that are synchronized with the new application roadmap</li>
</ul>
<strong>Benefits of Modernization</strong>
<ul>
    <li>Improved and differentiated customer experience.</li>
    <li>Accelerated innovation, reduced time to market, and frequent release of new products.</li>
    <li>Optimized and reduced costs on IT infrastructure spendings.</li>
    <li>Increased agility, enhanced features and functionalities at scale.</li>
    <li>Increased staff productivity by faster deployment of new features.</li>
    <li>Improved service-level agreements (SLAs) and reduced unplanned outages.</li>
</ul>
<p>The journey to modernization is an incremental effort. Continuous modernization across all areas of the
organization is the key to success. To get the full value of modernization, your strategy should focus on
understanding choices and tradeoffs, and the ability to combine and connect enterprise, differentiated,
undifferentiated, and commodity applications.</p>
